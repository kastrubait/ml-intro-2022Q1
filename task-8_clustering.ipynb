The maximum possible amount is 10 points, and together with the bonus assignment - 12 points. It is not necessary to complete all the tasks, only a part can be done. Most of the points expect you to write working Python code; sometimes you will need to write comments - for example, to compare several approaches to solve the same problem. Also you can add more cells for your convenience if you need."

    "\n",
    "In some cases, especially when there are a large number of features, when not all of them are informative, and some of them are correlated, it can be useful to reduce the dimension of the feature space. This mean that instead of $d$ original features, we will go to $d'\\ll d$ new ones. And if earlier our data were presented in the form of an $n√ód$ matrix, then it will presented as a $n√ód'$.\n",
